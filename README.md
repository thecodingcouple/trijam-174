# trijam-174
Source code for our Trijam #174 entry.  The theme is "Game based on a quote."

[Trijam](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-174) is a weekly game jam where the goal is to create a game in under 3 hours (per a team member) of development time. 

## Synopsis


> Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stÃ¤rker
>
> What does not kill me makes me stronger
>
> *- Friedrich Nietzsche*


*What Doesn't Kill Me* is a math-based puzzle and memory game. Players assume the role of a scientist conduting an antibiotic experiment on a bacteria.  Each round players use antibiotics to weaken the bacteria with the objective of not killing it. 

If players kill the bacteria the game is over.  If they manage to weaken it just enough, the bacteria survives, stronger than ever for the next round.

### How to play

* Click on an antibiotic to weaken the bacteria. Each antibiotic has a different damage value. 
* Apply damage 4 times with the goal of not killing the bacteria to advance to the next round.
